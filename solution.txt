# 1. In this directory, create a new directory called star_wars. Example answer: mkdir star_wars
mkdir star_wars
# 2. In the star_wars folder, create two new directories: empire and rebellion (This can be done in two commands, but how would you do it in one?)
mkdir empire rebellion
# 3. Inside the empire directory, create a file called darth_vader.txt 
touch darth_vader.txt
# 4. Use the force (or your echo) to add the text "...heavy breathing..." to the darth_vader.txt file (Don’t remember how to do this? Use the ‘other force’, known as Google!)
echo "...heavy breathing..." > darth_vader.txt
# 5. Inside the empire directory, create a file called emperor_palpatine.txt
touch emperor_palpatine.txt
# 6. Inside the empire directory, create a directory called death_star
mkdir death_star
# 7. Move darth_vader.txt into the death_star
mv darth_vader.txt death_star
# 1. Inside the `star_wars/rebellion` directory, (IN ONE COMMAND) create a file called princess_leia.txt with the text "Help me, Obi-Wan…You’re my only hope."
touch princess_leia.txt && echo echo "Help me, Obi-Wan…You’re my only hope." > princess_leia.txt
# 2. Create a file called obi_wan.txt in star_wars/rebellion
touch obi_wan.txt
# 3. Create a file in star_wars/rebellion called luke_skywalker.txt
touch luke_skywalker.txt
# 4. Create a directory in star_wars/rebellion called millenium_falcon
mkdir millenium_falcon
# 5. Inside the millenium_falcon, create two files: han_solo.txt and chewbacca.txt
touch han_solo.txt chewbacca.txt
# 6. Move luke_skywalker, obi_wan, and princess_leia into the millenium_falcon, respectively.
mv luke_skywalker.txt obi_wan.txt princess_leia.txt ~/Documents/General\ Assembly/homework/Star_Wars/star_wars/rebellion/millenium_falcon
# 7. Move the millenium_falcon into the death_star.
mv millenium_falcon ~/Documents/General\ Assembly/homework/Star_Wars/star_wars/empire/death_star
# 1. Unload the Millenium Falcon in ONE COMMAND!
# Move the whole crew from the millenium_falcon directory into the death_star directory. HINT: * following a directory will grab all files/folders inside of a directory (directory/*)
mv millenium_falcon/* ~/Documents/General\ Assembly/homework/Star_Wars/star_wars/empire/death_star
# 2. darth_vader has defeated obi_wan! Delete poor obi_wan.
rm obi_wan.txt 
# 3.  Our heroes have disabled the tractor beam! Move the whole crew back into the millenium_falcon!
# Remember: darth_vader remains in the death_star and emperor_palpatine is still in the empire.
mv luke_skywalker.txt chewbacca.txt han_solo.txt princess_leia.txt ~/Documents/General\ Assembly/homework/Star_Wars/star_wars/empire/death_star/millenium_falcon 
# 4. Move the millenium_falcon back into the rebellion directory.
mv millenium_falcon ~/mv luke_skywalker.txt chewbacca.txt han_solo.txt princess_leia.txt ~/Documents/General\ Assembly/homework/Star_Wars/star_wars/rebellion 
# 5. darth_vader leaves the death_star to pursue luke_skywalker! Move him from the death_star into the empire directory!
mv darth_vader.txt ~/mv millenium_falcon ~/mv luke_skywalker.txt chewbacca.txt han_solo.txt princess_leia.txt ~/Documents/General\ Assembly/homework/Star_Wars/star_wars/rebellion
# 6. Thanks to his practice back home at Beggar’s Canyon, Luke blew up the death_star! Remove it from the galaxy!
rm -R death_star
